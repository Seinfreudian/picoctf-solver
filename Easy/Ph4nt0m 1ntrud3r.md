A PCAP(Packet Capture) file is given to analyse network traffic at the moment of attack, since the prompt says that the attacker covered traces up well, most is dependednt on applying the right filters and finding the flag.
<h5>"A PCAP (Packet Capture) file is a binary file format used to store network traffic data captured from a network interface. It contains raw data packets, including both headers and payloads, providing a detailed record of communication between devices on a network"</h5>
so 2 out of 3 hints say that the time/frequency of attacks is important, so the filters must be applied as such. Open PCAP files in wireshark.

apply tcp.len==4 || tcp.len==12 as a filter,
then catch the payload of each tcp(it's in hex),
use hex to ascii converter
1st - 63 47 6c 6a 62 30 4e 55 52 67 3d 3d
2nd - cGljb0NURg==
3rd - YmhfNHJfZA==
4th - bnRfdGg0dA==
5th - MTA2NTM4NA==
6th - XzM0c3lfdA==
7th - fQ==

convert ascii to base64:
1 - {1t_w4s
2 - picoCTF
3 - bh_4r_dbh_4r_d
4 - nt_th4t
5 - 1065384
6 - `_34sy_t`
7 - }

an easier way is to go through the commands using tshark(terminal wireshark) step by step:
`tshark -r myNetworkTraffic.pcap -Y "tcp" -T fields -e tcp.segment_data | xxd -p -r | base64 -d`
-r `<filename>`: reads the file pcap
-Y `<filter>`: applies filter and shows the view
-T fields -e tcp.segment_data : output specified fields not verbose packet dump here it is tcp payload/segment data(in hex)
-xxd -p : makes a hex dump
-r : reverses the hex dump into raw binary
-base64 -d : binary as base64 to ascii

This only gives tcp packets (ALL)
Using
`tshark -r myNetworkTraffic.pcap -Y "tcp.len==12" -T fields -e tcp.segment_data | xxd -p -r | base64 -d`
gives tcp of length 12, we get the valid packets, but they're out of order

`┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop] └─$ tshark -r myNetworkTraffic.pcap -Y "tcp.len==12" -T fields -e tcp.segment_data | xxd -p -r | base64 -d {1t_w4spicoCTFbh_4r_dnt_th4t1065384_34sy_t`
<i>Out of order output</i>

Using:
`tshark -r myNetworkTraffic.pcap -Y "tcp.len==12 || tcp.len==4" -T fields -e frame.time -e tcp.segment_data | sort -k4 | awk '{print $6}' | xxd -p -r | base64 -d`
tcp length 4 is included since it's an anomalous tcp length in the file anyways
-T fields -e frame.time : orders them by time frame
-sort -k4 : sort output by 4th column, timefield so that TCP packets in chronological order
-awk '{print $6}' : prints 6th column only(hex dump) or payload

so we get the output flag!
