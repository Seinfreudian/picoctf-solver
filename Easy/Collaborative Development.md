you need to see the git history and what was stored.
at first, just do `git branch -a` - shows all available branches
`git checkout feature/part-1` - enter that part of version control
do `git log` and you see the commit history is different, meaning there are changes here
visit flag.py, you get your 1st part of the flag!
do `git branch -a` again and `git checkout feature/part-2`.
`git log` shows that there's a part 2 here. open flag.py and see the part 2 of it. YOu get the 2nd part of your flag!
do the same again in part-3, you'll get the 3rd part of your flag!
combine the flags and enter it!
